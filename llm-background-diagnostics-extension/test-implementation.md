# Implementation Test Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `src/llmIntegrationService.ts`
- ✅ Defined `LLMIssue` interface with 1-based line/column numbers
- ✅ Implemented `LLMIntegrationService` class with mock `analyzeDocument` method
- ✅ Mock returns plausible issues for lines 2 and 5 with appropriate delays

### 2. Updated `src/extension.ts`
- ✅ Added imports for `LLMIntegrationService` and `LLMIssue`
- ✅ Instantiated `LLMIntegrationService` in the `activate` function
- ✅ Modified callback to be async and accept `newHash` parameter
- ✅ Integrated LLM analysis into the document change callback
- ✅ Added proper 1-based to 0-based coordinate conversion for `vscode.Range`
- ✅ Moved `updateStoredHash` call to after successful analysis

### 3. Updated `src/fileContentMonitoringService.ts`
- ✅ Added `analysisTimeout` private member for throttling
- ✅ Updated callback signature to be async and accept `newHash` parameter
- ✅ Implemented throttling using `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout`
- ✅ Added timeout clearing in `dispose()` method
- ✅ Integrated `analysisInterval` from configuration service

## Key Features Implemented

### Throttling Mechanism
- Document changes trigger a throttled analysis based on `analysisInterval` configuration (default: 3000ms)
- Previous timeouts are cleared when new changes occur
- Analysis only happens after the specified delay to reduce unnecessary API calls

### Mock LLM Integration
- Simulates 500ms API call delay
- Returns mock issues for documents with sufficient lines
- Proper coordinate conversion from 1-based LLM format to 0-based VS Code format

### Hash Update Timing
- Hash is updated only after successful analysis completion
- Ensures consistency between stored hash and analyzed content

## Compilation Status
✅ TypeScript compilation successful with no errors
✅ All files compiled to `out/` directory
